// "Allah says: For how many years did you stay on earth? They reply: We stayed for a day or part of a day. Ask of those who are able to keep count of this. Allah says: You stayed but for a short while, if only you had known (how short it was to be and acted accordingly)! Or did you think that We created you in vain, and that you should devote all your time to play and entertainment, and that you would not be brought back to us? (23:112-115).",
